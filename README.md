This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length'). The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version.  The error arises from attempting to access the 'length' property of an undefined value. The solution involves explicitly checking for undefined before accessing the property.
